## Alexa Skill for Kenguru Guesthouse

This is a work in progress towards a full features skill that will use AWS Dynamo to access all guesthouse relevant information. The goal to achieve here is to create a professional looking Alexa Skill for the Echo Show device that can:

- List all future and past daily lunch specials
- Show recipes of popular food items so that interested persons can try these at home.
- Show guesthouse room information.
- Allow interested parties to obtain the contact information of the guesthouse.
